Here's an example SQL query to generate a table called products with 4 columns (id, name, price, description):

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    price REAL,
    description TEXT
);
This query will create a table named "products" with four columns: "id" (integer), "name" (text), "price" (real), and "description" (text). The "id" column is defined as the primary key, which means that each row in the table must have a unique "id" value.

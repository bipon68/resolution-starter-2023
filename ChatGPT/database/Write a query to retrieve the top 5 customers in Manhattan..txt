Assuming there is a "customers" table with columns "id", "name", "city", and "state", and a "orders" table with columns "id", "customer_id", and "order_total", and the "customers" table has a foreign key reference to the "orders" table via the "customer_id" column:

sql
Copy code
SELECT customers.id, customers.name, SUM(orders.order_total) as total_spent
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
WHERE customers.city = 'Manhattan' AND customers.state = 'NY'
GROUP BY customers.id, customers.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
This query joins the "customers" and "orders" tables based on the "customer_id" column, then selects the top 5 customers in Manhattan based on their total spending across all orders. The results are grouped by customer ID and name, sorted by total spending in descending order, and limited to the top 5 rows.

OR, 

SELECT name, address
FROM customers
WHERE city 'Manhattan'
ORDER BY id DESC
LIMIT 5

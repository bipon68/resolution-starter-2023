Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for the opportunity to work at this company for the past three years. I am proud of the work I have accomplished here, and I believe that my contributions have been valuable to the team and the company as a whole.

As you know, I have successfully delivered several projects on time and have consistently worked to ensure that our team meets or exceeds our goals. I have enjoyed taking on new challenges and have been able to grow both professionally and personally during my time here.

With that being said, I would like to request a raise in my salary. I believe that my hard work, dedication, and success make me a valuable asset to the company, and I would like my compensation to reflect that. I am open to discussing what a reasonable increase might be, and I am willing to work with you to determine what would be appropriate based on my performance and the company's budget.

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to continuing to work with you and the team to achieve our goals.

Best regards,
